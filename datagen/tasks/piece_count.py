"""Task: piece_count — list piece counts for both sides.

Deterministic: every question asks for the counts of both sides. No entity
selection. Side markers are literal strings (`"white"`/`"black"` in abs,
`"player"`/`"opponent"` in POV) since we have no special tokens for sides
yet — they appear in both prose and parse_tag. Each side is guaranteed a
king, so n=0 for any whole side is impossible; per-piece absences are
simply omitted (no `<PIECE>0` or `<EMPTY>` entries).

parse_tag layout (newline-separated):

    {side1_label}
    {side1 compact piece list}
    {side2_label}
    {side2 compact piece list}

Grader: sectioned multiset (`utils.eval_utils._piece_count_grade`) — the
two side labels must match exactly; each side's compact piece line is
compared as a counted multiset (so the order within a side is free, but
pieces can't leak across sides).
