"""Task: piece_on_rank — "what pieces are on this rank?"

Single task with two prose families (direct vs CoT) sampled per question.
Rank selection is uniform over the 8 ranks (no answer-side balance).
Compact piece-with-count encoding `<PIECE>?N` in parse_tag + answer_class
via `datagen.prose.encode_piece_count`; reused across the line tasks and
piece_count. Grader: counted multiset (`utils.eval_utils._multiset_grade`).
